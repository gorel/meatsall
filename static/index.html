    <h3>Rating philosophy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>0 (meats none) - didn't even give us food</li>
      <li>
        1 (meats some) - gave us food but it was bad and I couldn't finish it
      </li>
      <li>
        2 (meats most) - food was good, but not better than the average meal I
        cook at home
      </li>
      <li>
        3 (meats all) - food was good, better than the average meal I cook at
        home, and I'd be happy having a meal like this every day
      </li>
      <li>
        4 (exceeds) - food was great, better than most meals I cook at home, and
        I'm thinking about getting seconds
      </li>
      <li>
        5 (greatly exceeds) - food was phenomenal, better than anything I've
        ever cooked at home, and I'm getting seconds even if I'm full
      </li>
      <li>
        6 (redefines) - This is literally the best thing I've ever eaten and now
        the rating philosophy needs to be updated
      </li>

            3.0 - The Korean fried chicken wings were tender yet crispy and the
            breading had the perfect amount of salt. The sides were average -
            the steamed rice and green beans lacked flavor, but were cooked very
            well. The sauteed cabbage, on other hand, was excellent. I explored
            the pizza option as well - the spicy Hawaiian pizza wasn't
            particularly spicy, but the pineapple was fresh, which made the
            pizza above average. Overall this was a solid meal that was on the
            brink of a higher rating.

            4.0 - A delight for the senses! The Sichuan chicken was delicious
            and the chili oil really brought out the best flavors in the dish.
            For sides, we had delectable broccoli and green beans with a helping
            of jasmine rice on the side. This easily exceeded my expectations
            and I found myself longing for more by the end. For dessert, we had
            churros and chocolate - quite a departure from the "Sichuan" theme
            of the main course, and honestly, it's my biggest point of
            criticism: the chocolate itself was a bit overly sweet, and the
            lingering hint of chili oil from the chicken resulted in me
            questioning the combination. Nevertheless, such a strong main course
            led me to keeping my initial rating of a 4.0 because I would gladly
            eat this again. Kudos to the chefs!
