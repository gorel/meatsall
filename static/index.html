    <h3>Rating philosophy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>0 (meats none) - didn't even give us food</li>
      <li>
        1 (meats some) - gave us food but it was bad and I couldn't finish it
      </li>
      <li>
        2 (meats most) - food was good, but not better than the average meal I
        cook at home
      </li>
      <li>
        3 (meats all) - food was good, better than the average meal I cook at
        home, and I'd be happy having a meal like this every day
      </li>
      <li>
        4 (exceeds) - food was great, better than most meals I cook at home, and
        I'm thinking about getting seconds
      </li>
      <li>
        5 (greatly exceeds) - food was phenomenal, better than anything I've
        ever cooked at home, and I'm getting seconds even if I'm full
      </li>
      <li>
        6 (redefines) - This is literally the best thing I've ever eaten and now
        the rating philosophy needs to be updated
      </li>

            <td>4.0 - A delight for the senses! The Sichuan chicken was delicious and the chili oil really brought out
            the best flavors in the dish. For sides, we had delectable broccoli and green beans with a helping of
            jasmine rice on the side. This easily exceeded my expectations and I found myself longing for more by the
            end. For dessert, we had churros and chocolate - quite a departure from the "Sichuan" theme of the main
            course, and honestly, it's my biggest point of criticism: the chocolate itself was a bit overly sweet, and
            the lingering hint of chili oil from the chicken resulted in me questioning the combination. Nevertheless,
            such a strong main course led me to keeping my initial rating of a 4.0 because I would gladly eat this
            again. Kudos to the chefs!</td>
          <td>
            3.0 - chicken was dry but flavor was pretty good and sides were
            solid.
