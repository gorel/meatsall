    <h3>Rating philosophy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>0 (meats none) - didn't even give us food</li>
      <li>
        1 (meats some) - gave us food but it was bad and I couldn't finish it
      </li>
      <li>
        2 (meats most) - food was good, but not better than the average meal I
        cook at home
      </li>
      <li>
        3 (meats all) - food was good, better than the average meal I cook at
        home, and I'd be happy having a meal like this every day
      </li>
      <li>
        4 (exceeds) - food was great, better than most meals I cook at home, and
        I'm thinking about getting seconds
      </li>
      <li>
        5 (greatly exceeds) - food was phenomenal, better than anything I've
        ever cooked at home, and I'm getting seconds even if I'm full
      </li>
      <li>
        6 (redefines) - This is literally the best thing I've ever eaten and now
        the rating philosophy needs to be updated
      </li>
